# Apriori_Big_Data

## Project Description:
In this project Apriori algorithm is applied to find all the association rules in the given dataset. The dataset itself represents the customer data for an insurance company; it has 86 attributes with 5822 records. The Algorithm finds all the possible association rules for user-defined values of support and confidence, in addition to computing the lift and leverage for each rule to prioritize the rules. Only 12 attributes are chosen for the algorithm to work on them, starting from index 11

## Project Aims:
This project aims to calculate the Apriori algorithm and generate all valid association rules to predict which customers are potentially interested in an insurance policy and to describe the actual or potential customers; and possibly explain why these customers buy a policy.

## Project Objectives:
- Calculate Apriori algorithm to generate valid association rules based on user-defined minimum support and minimum confidence 
- Calculate and output the support for each valid association rule 
- Calculate and output the confidence for each valid association rule 
- Calculate and output the lift for each valid association rule 
- Calculate and output the leverage for each valid association rule
